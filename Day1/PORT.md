# Managing Processes on Specific Ports in Linux (UBUNTU)

I encountered an **"Address already in use"** error when launching applications indicates that a specific port is occupied by another process. 

To resolve this, it's essential to:

1. **Identify the Process ID (PID) associated with a specific port.**
2. **Terminate the process safely and effectively.**
3. **Verify that the port is free after termination.**

## üîç Identifying the Process ID (PID) Using the Port Number

Several commands can help determine which process is using a specific port:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using `lsof` (List Open Files)

The `lsof` command lists open files and network connections. To find the PID associated with a specific port:

```bash
lsof -i :<port_number>
```

**Example:**

```bash
lsof -i :8080
```

This command outputs details of the process using port `8080`, including the PID.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using `ss` (Socket Statistics)

The `ss` command provides detailed network socket information:

```bash
ss -tuln | grep :<port_number>
```

**Example:**

```bash
ss -tuln | grep :8080
```

This displays the process details listening on port `8080`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Using `netstat` (Network Statistics)

Though deprecated in some distributions, `netstat` is still useful:

```bash
netstat -tuln | grep :<port_number>
```

**Example:**

```bash
netstat -tuln | grep :8080
```

This shows the process details for the specified port.

## ‚ùå Terminating the Process Using Its PID

After identifying the PID, you can terminate the process using the following methods:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using `kill` (Graceful Termination)

The `kill` command sends a signal to terminate the process:

```bash
kill <PID>
```

**Example:**

```bash
kill 1234
```

This sends the default `SIGTERM` signal, allowing the process to terminate gracefully.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using `fuser` to Kill a Process

The `fuser` command identifies processes using files or sockets:

```bash
fuser -k <port_number>/<protocol>
```

**Example:**

```bash
fuser -k 8080/tcp
```

This forcefully terminates the process using TCP port `8080`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Using `lsof` Combined with `kill`

You can combine `lsof` and `kill` to terminate the process:

```bash
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :<port_number>)
```

**Example:**

```bash
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :8080)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** Using `-9` sends the `SIGKILL` signal, which forcefully stops the process **without allowing it to perform cleanup operations**. Use this as a last resort.

---

## ‚úÖ Verifying That the Port Is Free

After terminating the process, ensure the port is free:

```bash
lsof -i :<port_number>
```

**Example:**

```bash
lsof -i :8080
```

If there's **no output**, the port is now free.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Permission Errors:** If you encounter permission denied errors, prepend `sudo` to your commands to execute them with superuser privileges.
- **Auto-Restarting Services:** Some services are configured to restart automatically upon termination. Ensure you stop the service properly using system service managers like `systemctl` or `service`:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
  ```

By following these steps, you can effectively manage processes occupying specific ports, ensuring smooth operation of your applications and services. üöÄ
